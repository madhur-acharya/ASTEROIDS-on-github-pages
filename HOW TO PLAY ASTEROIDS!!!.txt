This is my take on the arcade classic "asteroids". the objective is pretty simple. shoot asteroids and drones, collect powerups and try to get a high score.

//////INSTALATION GUIDE////
extract the files using WinRAR or WinZip.
open the "ASTEROIDS!!!.HTML" file in your google chrome web browser(you can use any other web browesr you like, but i highly recomend the latest version of google chrome).

the game controls are very simple.

UP-ARROW: 	thrust(moves in the direction you are pointing)
LEFT-ARROW: 	rotate left
RIGHT-ARROW: 	rotate right
DOWN_ARROW: 	break
SPACE: 		shoot
ESC: 		pause/ play
M: 		mute/ unmute background music
F11: 		Toggle fullscreen
K: 		skip
